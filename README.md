_________Basic Concepts #1_________
Task: 
Transportation
You are making a program for a bus service.
A bus can transport 50 passengers at once.
Given the number of passengers waiting in the bus station as input, you need to calculate and output how many empty seats the last bus will have.

Sample Input:
126

Sample Output:
24

Explanation: The first bus will transport 50 passengers, leaving 126-50=76 in the station. 
The next one will leave 26 in the station, thus, the last bus will take all of the 26 passengers, having 50-26=24 seats left empty.


_________Conditionals and Loops #2_________
Countdown
You need to make a countdown app.
Given a number N as input, output numbers from N to 1 on separate lines.
Also, when the current countdown number is a multiple of 5, the app should output "Beep".
Sample Input:
12

Sample Output:
12
11
10
Beep
9
8
7
6
5
Beep
4

_________DataType_Arrays_Pointers_________
Ticket Office
You are working on a ticketing system. A ticket costs $10.
The office is running a discount campaign: each group of 5 people is getting a discount, which is determined by the age of the youngest person in the group.
You need to create a program that takes the ages of all 5 people as input and outputs the total price of the tickets.

Sample Input:
55
28
15
38
63

Sample Output:
42.5

The youngest age is 15, so the group gets a 15% discount from the total price, which is $50 - 15% = $42.5


_________Polindrome_Numbers_________
Palindrome Numbers
A palindromic number is a number (such as 626) that remains the same when its digits are reversed.
Write a function that returns true if a given number is a palindrome, and false, if it is not.
Complete the given function, so that the code in main works and results in the expected output.

Sample Input:
13431

Sample Output:
13431 is a palindrome
